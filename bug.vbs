Late Binding and Implicit Type Conversion Issues: VBScript's late binding can lead to runtime errors that are difficult to debug during development.  Implicit type conversion can also cause unexpected results, especially when dealing with variant data types. For example, comparing a string "1" to a number 1 might not yield the expected Boolean result. Consider this VBScript code snippet:

```vbscript
Dim a, b
a = "1"
b = 1
If a = b Then
  MsgBox "Equal"
Else
  MsgBox "Not Equal"
End If
```

In this case, the comparison might fail because of type mismatch even though one expects them to be equal.  Proper type checking and explicit conversion should be used.
