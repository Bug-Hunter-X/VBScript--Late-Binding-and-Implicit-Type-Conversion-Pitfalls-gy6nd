This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in VBScript programming related to late binding and implicit type conversion.  The `bug.vbs` file contains code that showcases the issue, where a string comparison with a number might produce unexpected results. The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides the corrected version with explicit type handling.  This is a practical example highlighting the importance of robust type checking in VBScript to avoid runtime surprises.
